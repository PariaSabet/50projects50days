            <h1>Salads and their benefits </h1>
            <small>Copied from internet</small>
            <p>
                Salads composed from even a few ingredients make a nutrient-rich meal. The greens alone have calcium,
                iron, potassium and B vitamins. Many salad basics, including tomatoes, sweet peppers and the greens,
                are chock-full of antioxidants. Add high fiber and low calories into the mix and you can't go wrong
                including a salad in your daily diet. </p>
            <h3>Dietary Fiber & Packed with Antioxidants</h3>

                Eating enough fiber earlier in life lowers the risk of developing heart disease later in life,
                according to researchers at Northwestern University. Vegetables in salads are good sources of insoluble
                fiber, which keeps your digestive tract healthy. If you add nuts, seeds or beans to the salad, you’ll
                get a boost of soluble fiber that helps lower cholesterol and keeps blood sugar balanced. Men should
                get 38 grams and women need 25 grams of fiber in their daily diet. One cup of iceberg lettuce with
                one-half carrot and one-quarter of a red pepper provides 7 percent of men’s and 10 percent of women’s
                daily fiber intake. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    Many salad ingredients contain vitamin C and vitamin A in the form of antioxidant carotenoids. In addition to 7 milligrams of vitamin C, 1 cup of spinach has 93 percent and green leaf lettuce has 88 percent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin A. Add half of a medium-sized carrot and you'll gain more than 100 percent of your daily vitamin A. Vegetables that have a better mix of both antioxidants include sweet red peppers, tomatoes and broccoli. Sweet red peppers are an especially good choice. One-half cup provides 77 percent of the daily intake of vitamin A and 158 percent of vitamin C.
